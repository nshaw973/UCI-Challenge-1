# Challenge 1 Description

## Work Done

 Although the code did have some proper elements, such as p ul and li, alonside the <html> abd <body> tags.
 It was missing it's Header, main, and sections elements that are normally very prominent in html files.
 Once the elements where properly renamed to help create a readble codebase, I went ahead and began moving some of the code around to make it a little more uniform to prevent it looking like shark teeth with the code making pyramid shapes.
 Even adding spaces between each main and section elements to help it make it easier on the eyes to find each Main section of the document and its relation with each child and parent element.
